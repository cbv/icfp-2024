Utilities for working with (or creating) fonts, including both
bitmap and vector fonts.

See ../stb_truetype.h for loading truetype fonts.

See ../../bit7 for some embeddable fonts (in progress); maybe
should be moved here?

DFXPasement9x.ttf is a simple (fake bitmap) font that is here
for testing.
