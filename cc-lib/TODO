- be consistent about color-util vs colorutil
- rename stb_image_write vs stb-image-write etc.
- non-SDL RGBA array library. fonts can draw to it (this is started in
  image.cc).
- thread-util with progress feedback (e.g. ansi console, sdl)
- thread pools
- clean up style (use uppercase function and class names, like in sdlutil?)
- Good standalone flate/zlib compressor:
    https://github.com/google/zopfli/tree/master/src/zopfli
- Fast standalone compressor/decompressor: https://github.com/google/snappy
    (zstd is probably better now)
- Make a single-file (or otherwise embeddable) zstd
- CHACHA2020 as a replacement for arcfour
- Make randutil templated over prng, and provide good defaults
- Make black-box optimizer open-loop
- Autotune parameters, like autoparallel but with user-specified metrics
  (e.g. you define a target "error" and some variables, it gives you
   variables to try for a round, then you tell it what the "error" was)
- Update bigz in bignum (there is now 2.0.0, with bugfixes)
- macro that uses __builtin_unreachable() for an unchecked assert() that
  can be used for optimization assertions. (There may now be a standardized
  version of this.)
